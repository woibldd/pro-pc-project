                "erc1155":"ERC-1155 is a token standard that enables the efficient transfer of fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single transaction. It supports an infinite number of tokens, in contrast with ERC-20 and ERC-721, which require a new smart contract for each type of token. It supports not only fungible and non-fungible tokens, but also semi-fungible tokens. It removes the need to \"approve\" individual token contracts separately, which means signing fewer transactions"
